## Product

Human feelings are an inherent part of their nature and influence their thinking, behavior, and performance. 

Emotions at work have a big impact on how the task turns out. As a result, managers can forecast work results by observing their workforce's attitudes and feelings. 

As shown in studies, decision makers tend to base their decisions more on emotion than on logic, therefore controlling emotions and mood at work is crucial for wise choices. 

Additionally, they can design and modify the work environment to make it welcome. This will attract top talent, foster loyalty, boost engagement, and foster innovation. 

On the other hand, they can foresee and avert future issues, like burnout, disputes, and production drops. 

For that, we developed a system called Tabeer that detects facial expressions from photos and videos. It classifies them based on seven basic emotions. These are Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprised. 

Tabeer will pick up facial expressions twice during the work, once at the start and at the finish. The system will analyze and classify facial expressions according to emotional categories, store the data, and provide real time statistics on each employee's performance and emotional state. So, managers can take decisions based on the system's results to improve and enhance the workplace. 

Our future plans are to improve the system and provide more features like a summary of employees' emotional states and to provide tips based on their emotional states, as well as alarms when the system detects any strange changes in the emotional states of the employees. 


## Challenge 
Mood is a feeling or emotional state that can affect the individual’s performance, intellectual function, productivity, and creativity. in contrast, that can affect the company’s overall in terms of outcomes, turnover rate, the relationship between employees, and atmosphere at organization. So, monitoring the mood state for the employees is crucial.  


## Solution 
Our system shows statistics of the moods of employees against their performance, so that helps the management to first predict the status of each employee in the workplace, and thus could improve it. Secondly, anticipate future problems that might occur and lastly, help managers to plan for incentives, entertainment, and increase employees’ engagement.
